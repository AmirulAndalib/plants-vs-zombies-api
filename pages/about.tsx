          <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-14 ml-7">What is an API?</h3>
          <p className="mx-10 mt-4">
            An API (Application Programming Interface) is a contract that allow
            developers to interact with an application through a set of
            interfaces. In this case, the application is a database of thousands
            of Plants vs Zombies-related objects, and the interfaces are URL
            links.<br></br>
          </p>
          <p className="mx-10 mt-1">
            A RESTful API is an API that conforms to a set of loose conventions
            based on HTTP verbs, errors, and hyperlinks.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-14 ml-7">
            Aren't there any <abbr title="Plants vs Zombies API">PVZ API</abbr>{" "}
            already?
          </h3>
          <p className="mx-10 mt-3">
            As far as we know there is no other API for Plants VS Zombies-2
            though there are some websites exist. We aim to provide a single
            source of data that any number of other websites can consume and
            use.
          </p>
          <p className="mx-10 mt-1">
            We updates often which prevents bugs and addition of new data about
            plants,zombies and areas after each update
          </p>
          <p className="mx-10 mt-1">
            Often, and especially when new Plants vs Zombies updates are
            released, those websites take weeks to update as people have to
            enter the same information in all those different places. This
            solves that problem. If all those sites consumed their data from
            here, they would have the exact same information that is updated at
            exactly the same time, with no errors between each website. The
            overall benefit is a better collaboration and consistency across all
            the different Pok√©mon websites and applications. It's good for all!
